# Zipfslaw-thirukural
Zipf's law states that The frequency of any word in a text is inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency table. It simply means that the most common word appears approximately twice as often as the second most common word, three times as often as the third most common word, and so on. This relationship follows a power-law distribution.
